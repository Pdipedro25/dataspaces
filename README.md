Project for <a href="https://didattica.polito.it/pls/portal30/sviluppo.guide.visualizza?p_cod_ins=01RLPNG&p_a_acc=2017&p_lang=IT">Data Spaces Course</a>. We worked on <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Drug+consumption+%28quantified%29">Drug consumption (quantified) Data Set</a>, we performed EDA (_explanatory data analysis_), _Multiclass Classification_ to detect LSD user with usage class, and _Binary Classification_ for detect user/non user. We used several classifier such as __SVM, GNB, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.__ and different data manipulation techniques such as __PCA, data cleaning, etc.__
 
The whole project was made in __Python__ (Jupyter Notebook format) with usage on __sklearn, pandas, matplotlib,__ etc.
